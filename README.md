<p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>

<p> Hi, my name is Yailine Cano <p>
<p> I am studying Game Production Management <p>
<p> Prior to coming to Illinois Tech, I went to Von Steuben High School in Chicago. There I was the President of the eSports team for 3 years and Vice President for 1 year. Then I became President of the Spanish Honor Society Chapter for 2 years and Secretary for 1 year. In my last year of high school, I founded the first Computer Science Honor Society Chapter, originating from a non-selective enrollment school in all of Chicago Public Schools. <p>
